           <h1>Our Philosophy</h1> 
           <p>Highs and lows are a part of life, and life must go on. To keep our lives going on, we need certain conflicts
            and issues unaddressed. These issues remain under the surface until they all pile up and become a mountain
            that then starts trying to rupture our emotional skin and break out.At such moments, people usually get puzzled 
            and can't make sense of what is happening to them as they lose track of their past issues. It does not represent any 
            emotional weakness or mental instability. It is natural and happens to everybody.Sometimes, talking with your 
            close friends and family members helps suppress the issues and give you a break until they break out again. And sometimes, it is just not enough.That is when you need professional help like the one we offer. It would help if you had an environment where you can talk to somebody who listens, understands and can propose solutions in a non-judgmental and private manner.

        <p class="last-para">And you don't need to reach out for professional help only when you are breaking down. Regular therapy sessions, whenever you feel the need to have one, are very effective to deal with the issues right when they happen. Regular therapy also keeps the issues from piling up and becoming big trouble.Our therapy is highly recommended if you are having a tough time in your life, whether emotionally or psychologically.They are also recommended to avoid being in a tough situation. Not only that, therapy sessions are a very effective way to emotionally and psychologically progress in your life. You may seek counselling if you want to come out of your comfort zone and explore new horizons.Having regular therapy generally is a very healthy practice as it just introduces you and brings you closer to your true self. It teaches you how to brace it, love it, and make the best out of it
